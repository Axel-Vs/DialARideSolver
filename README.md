# Parcel Delivery Optimizer
The Parcel Delivery Optimizer optimizes the delivery of packages, documents, and mail from one location to another. This solution improves upon regular mail services by offering more features such as express shipping, tracking, secure delivery, and the specialization and individualization of express services. It is designed for speed, security, tracking, signature, specialization, and individualization of services, swift delivery times, and the ability to handle valuable items. <br>

The Parcel Delivery Optimizer can be utilized by businesses and individuals alike. Businesses can use these services to connect with their customers, deliver goods, and send critical documents quickly and securely. Individuals might use the Parcel Delivery Optimizer for sending personal documents, delivering gifts, or shipping purchases or sales from online transactions.<br>

In terms of logistics, the Parcel Delivery Optimizer relies on a network of vehicles and transportation infrastructure to ensure timely and efficient delivery. <br>

## Algorithms
* Quantum Annealing: Quantum Annealing is a metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions. Quantum annealing uses quantum mechanics to perform optimization and search tasks far more efficiently than traditional methods. In this project, we apply Quantum Annealing to optimize parcel delivery by mapping the problem into a suitable Ising model, finding optimal solutions in a significantly reduced search space. <br>

* CBC Solver: The Coin-or branch and cut (CBC) is an open-source linear programming solver that is part of the COIN-OR project. It is a highly efficient algorithm used for solving linear programming problems, mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. For optimizing parcel delivery, we utilize CBC to model and solve the problem as a MIP. By doing so, we can find optimal or near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational time. <br>

Each of these algorithms presents its own benefits and trade-offs. Quantum Annealing provides a quantum-computational approach that can potentially find optimal solutions in a reduced search space, while the CBC Solver uses traditional mathematical programming techniques that are proven to be effective for such combinatorial problems.
