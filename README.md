# DialARideSolver
An implementation of various algorithms for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP). Focused on optimizing vehicle routing and scheduling for ride-sharing services to minimize travel time and improve customer satisfaction.


## Overview
The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) is an optimization problem that involves the scheduling and routing of vehicles to pick up and deliver passengers while meeting a set of service constraints. This project tackles this problem by implementing various algorithms to provide an efficient solution, ultimately aiming to minimize travel time and improve customer satisfaction.
